# Coherence Metrics Canvas

## What This Is

Stop measuring whether content is identical across touchpoints. Start measuring whether it's coherently purposeful. This canvas helps teams define and track metrics that matter for distributed coherence.

**How to use:** Complete each quadrant with your team. Review quarterly. Adjust metrics as your coherence understanding matures.

## Quadrant 1: Brand Coherence

**The question:** Do users recognize they're in your product across touchpoints?

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Indicates | Target Direction |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Cross-channel recognition** | Users identify brand without explicit cues | Higher is better |
| **Voice consistency perception** | Users feel content "sounds like" the brand | Higher is better |
| **Trust transfer** | Trust built in one channel carries to others | Higher is better |
| **Confusion incidents** | Users uncertain if content is from you | Lower is better |

### Measurement Methods

**Cross-channel recognition:**
- Survey: "Which company do you think created this content?" (unbranded samples)
- A/B test: Does adding brand cues change comprehension/trust?

**Voice consistency perception:**
- Survey: "Does this sound like [Brand]?" (1-5 scale across channels)
- Qualitative: User interviews about brand perception across touchpoints

**Trust transfer:**
- Measure: Conversion rates from new channels with established users vs. new users
- Track: Support escalations mentioning cross-channel confusion

**Confusion incidents:**
- Monitor: Support tickets mentioning uncertainty about authenticity
- Track: Phishing/scam reports (users can't distinguish your content)

## Quadrant 2: Functional Coherence

**The question:** Can users accomplish goals regardless of channel?

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Indicates | Target Direction |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Task completion by channel** | Users can accomplish goals anywhere | Parity across channels |
| **Cross-channel journey completion** | Users switching channels still succeed | Higher is better |
| **Information parity** | Same information accessible (appropriately) everywhere | Higher is better |
| **Channel-specific friction** | Channels where content creates friction | Lower is better |

### Measurement Methods

**Task completion by channel:**
- Track completion rates for key tasks across all channels
- Look for channels with significantly lower completion

**Cross-channel journey completion:**
- Track users who start in one channel, finish in another
- Compare completion rates to single-channel journeys

**Information parity:**
- Audit: Map what information is available where
- Survey: "Were you able to find X when you needed it?"

**Channel-specific friction:**
- Measure: Drop-off points by channel for same task
- Qualitative: "What was confusing?" by channel

### Your Functional Coherence Metrics

| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Frequency |

## Quadrant 3: Value Coherence

**The question:** Does contextual content drive the outcomes we expect?

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Indicates | Target Direction |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Personalization lift** | Adapted content performs better than generic | Positive lift |
| **Localization ROI** | Adapted content drives regional performance | Positive ROI |
| **Context-appropriate satisfaction** | Right content reaches right users | Higher is better |
| **Adaptation quality** | Variations maintain quality, not just exist | Consistent quality |

### Measurement Methods

**Personalization lift:**
- A/B test: Personalized vs. generic content performance
- Track: Revenue/conversion difference for personalized experiences

**Localization ROI:**
- Calculate: Investment in localization vs. regional revenue increase
- Compare: Performance of localized vs. translated-only content

**Context-appropriate satisfaction:**
- Survey: "Was this content relevant to your situation?"
- Measure: Engagement rates by user segment/context

**Adaptation quality:**
- Audit: Score quality of variations against coherence markers
- Monitor: Performance of adapted content vs. source content

### Your Value Coherence Metrics

| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Frequency |

## Quadrant 4: Operational Coherence

**The question:** Can teams make decisions that maintain coherence at scale?

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Indicates | Target Direction |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Decision confidence** | Teams feel equipped to decide without escalating | Higher is better |
| **Escalation rate** | Decisions requiring central review | Lower (appropriate level) |
| **Time to content** | Speed from need to published content | Lower is better |
| **Coherence drift** | Content diverging from principles over time | Lower is better |

### Measurement Methods

**Decision confidence:**
- Survey: "I feel confident making content decisions without approval" (1-5)
- Track: Voluntary escalation requests over time

**Escalation rate:**
- Count: Decisions escalated to central review vs. made locally
- Trend: Direction of escalation rate over time

**Time to content:**
- Measure: Average time from content request to publication
- Compare: Time for centralized vs. distributed content creation

**Coherence drift:**
- Audit: Quarterly sample of content against coherence markers
- Track: Audit scores over time

### Your Operational Coherence Metrics

| Metric | Current State | Target | Measurement Frequency |
