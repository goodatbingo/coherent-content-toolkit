# Coherence Markers Worksheet

## What This Is

Coherence markers are the non-negotiable elements that make your content recognizably *yours*—not surface elements like capitalization conventions, but deeper decisions about how you relate to users. These markers must stay consistent even when everything else adapts to context.

**Time to complete:** 60-90 minutes with your core team  
**Who should participate:** Content leads, brand strategists, product owners, UX writers

## Part 1: User Agency

How do you treat user autonomy and decision-making?

### Directive ←→ Empowering Spectrum

Place an X where your content should fall:

```
Tell users          Give informed        Present options       Let users
what to do          recommendations      without preference    discover
    |___________________|___________________|___________________|
```

**Your position:** _______________________

### Key Questions

1. When users face a choice, do we make the decision for them or equip them to decide?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

2. Do we assume users want the "best" option or the option that fits their context?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

3. How do we handle situations where our recommendation conflicts with user preference?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

### Your User Agency Marker

Write one sentence that captures how your content treats user agency:

> ___________________________________________________________________________
> 
> ___________________________________________________________________________

**Example:** "We provide clear recommendations with transparent reasoning, but always give users the information to choose differently."

## Part 2: Complexity Handling

How do you help users navigate complicated topics?

### Simplify ←→ Sophisticate Spectrum

```
Reduce to           Abstract              Reveal layers        Teach full
essentials          complexity            progressively        complexity
    |___________________|___________________|___________________|
```

**Your position:** _______________________

### Key Questions

   _____________________________________________________________________________

2. When a topic is inherently complex, do we hide details or surface them appropriately?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

3. How do we handle expert users who need depth vs. novice users who need basics?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

### Your Complexity Marker

Write one sentence that captures how your content handles complexity:

> ___________________________________________________________________________
> 
> ___________________________________________________________________________

**Example:** "We start simple and layer depth—users can stop at any level and still succeed, but can always go deeper."

## Part 4: Business-User Balance

How do you handle conflicts between organizational goals and user needs?

### Prioritization Framework

When business goals and user needs conflict, we:

- [ ] Always prioritize user needs (business adjusts)

   _____________________________________________________________________________

3. What would we never do, even if it benefited the business?

   _____________________________________________________________________________

### Your Balance Marker

Write one sentence that captures how your content balances business and user needs:

> 
> ___________________________________________________________________________

**Example:** "We always acknowledge when we're asking something of users and make the value exchange explicit."

## Part 5: Attention & Time

How do you treat user attention as a resource?

### Attention Philosophy

```
Capture and         Earn attention       Respect attention    Minimize 
hold attention      through value        as finite            interaction time

> 
> ___________________________________________________________________________

**Example:** "We treat user attention as borrowed, not owned—every word must justify its presence."

## Part 7: Test Your Markers

### Scenario Testing

Apply your markers to these scenarios. Do they give clear guidance?

User encounters an error during checkout. How do your markers shape the message?

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 2: Upsell Moment**  
User completes a task and there's an opportunity to suggest a premium feature. How do your markers shape the approach?

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

**Scenario 3: Complex Feature**
User needs to configure an advanced setting with many interdependent options. How do your markers shape the experience?

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________

### Marker Refinement

Based on scenario testing, do any markers need adjustment?

## Part 8: Marker Application Guide

For each marker, provide guidance on how it applies across contexts:

### Example Application Table

| Marker | High-Stakes Context | Routine Context | Urgent Context |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------| ---------------|
| User Agency | Full reasoning provided | Clear recommendation | Quick default with escape hatch |
| Complexity | Progressive disclosure | Appropriate to task | Essential only |
| Trust | Complete transparency | Standard honesty | Acknowledge limitations quickly |
| Balance | User needs first | Mutual value | User needs with business context |
| Attention | Comprehensive but structured | Minimal but complete | Absolute minimum |

### Your Application Table

| Marker | High-Stakes Context | Routine Context | Urgent Context |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------| ---------------|
| User Agency | | | |
| Complexity | | | |
| Trust | | | |
| Balance | | | |
| Attention | | | |

## Usage Notes

**Review cadence:** Revisit markers quarterly or when major product/brand changes occur.

**Onboarding:** Use this worksheet with new team members to calibrate on coherence expectations.

**Disputes:** When team members disagree on content approach, reference markers as the tiebreaker.

**Evolution:** Markers can evolve, but changes should be deliberate and documented, not accidental drift.
